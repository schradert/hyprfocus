# hyprfocus

a plugin which provides focus animations for us borderless folks, originally inspired by [flashfocus](https://github.com/fennerm/flashfocus)!
Modified to work with the latest Hyprland and support hyprpm as well as some other improvements.

## getting started

to start using hyprfocus, add this to your hyprland config:

```
    hyprfocus {
        enabled = yes
        animate_floating = yes
        animate_workspacechange = yes
        focus_animation = shrink
        # Beziers for focus animations
        bezier = bezIn, 0.5,0.0,1.0,0.5
        bezier = bezOut, 0.0,0.5,0.5,1.0
        bezier = overshot, 0.05, 0.9, 0.1, 1.05
        bezier = smoothOut, 0.36, 0, 0.66, -0.56
        bezier = smoothIn, 0.25, 1, 0.5, 1
        bezier = realsmooth, 0.28,0.29,.69,1.08
        # Flash settings
        flash {
            flash_opacity = 0.95
            in_bezier = realsmooth
            in_speed = 0.5
            out_bezier = realsmooth
            out_speed = 3
        }
        # Shrink settings
        shrink {
            shrink_percentage = 0.95
            in_bezier = realsmooth
            in_speed = 1
            out_bezier = realsmooth
            out_speed = 2
        }
    }
```

### plugin configuration

`enabled` (yes/no) -> enable or disable the plugin

`focus_animation` (flash/shrink/none) -> animation for keyboard-driven focus

`animate_workspacechange` (yes/no) -> Whether to trigger the focus animation when changing workspaces

`animate_floating` (yes/no) -> Whether to trigger the focus animation for floating windows

### animations configuration

animations can be configured within the plugin scope with the following syntax:

```
plugin:hyprfocus {
    <animation> {

    }
}
```

### shared animation variables

`in_bezier` (bezier) -> bezier curve towards the animation apex

`out_bezier` (bezier) -> bezier curve towards the default window state

`in_speed` (float) -> speed for the 'in' bezier

`out_speed` (float) -> speed for the 'out' bezier

### flash

`flash_opacity` (float) -> opacity to during the flash's apex

### shrink

`shrink_percentage` (float) -> the amount a window has shrunk during the animation's apex

### dispatching

hyprfocus can also flash the currently focused window through the `animatefocused` dispatcher:

```
bind = $mod, space, animatefocused
```
